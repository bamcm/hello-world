## Tools/Methods

Outside of the millennial experience of using HTML for creating super sweet [MySpace](https://www.digitalspy.com/tech/a804288/things-youll-only-remember-if-you-were-addicted-to-myspace/) pages, I don't have any nitty, gritty tech skills. I would really like to be creative and use computer programming to merge my background in history with technological advances (basically, I'm really interested in digital humanities). I am looking forward to learning programming languages like Python and experimenting with (or breaking) various tools.
